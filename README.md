# Simply Phone

Sample coding illustrating a small application that allow a phone to be picked from a list box and more information about that phone can be displayed on a second screen.


## Features
The application uses C# and the WPF framework. Various patterns and functionality are demonstrated. Classes are split up into different folders which are reflected in the namespaces.

- Factory pattern
- WPF Binding
- Interface class
- MVVM
- Loading data from CSV
- Loading images into application

A singleton would be an equally valid approach to use in this application. 

## Additional images
Default image for phone from.
